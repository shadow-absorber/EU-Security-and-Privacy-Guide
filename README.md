# EU-Security-and-Privacy-Guide
A checklist of things you can do to improve your devices security and your privacy in the EU!

## Basic Things
- [ ] check privacy settings of all social medias you use!!!
- [ ] consider digital minimalism! i.e using as few digital services and accounts as possible. as data not collected can't be exploited or hacked!
- [ ] avoid internet of things devices( devices that connect to the internet when not needed ) as those can break your home networks security and breach your privacy!
- [ ] use private messengers like [signal](https://signal.org/), for even more privacy check out [session](https://getsession.org/) or [briar](https://briarproject.org/)
- [ ] change search engine to a more private one. recommended for most is [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [brave](https://search.brave.com/), searxng( check instances here [https://searx.space/](https://searx.space/) ).
- [ ] change browser to firefox( or forks like librewolf ) or if you need chromium! brave or thorium .
- [ ] use a password manager. recommended for most is [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for online password manager, and [keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/) for offline password manager.
- [ ] stop reusing passwords.
- [ ] check your email address on [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) and change passwords for services where your email has been leaked!!!
- [ ] setup authenticator app for 2fa on all sites that support it.

- [ ] generate random answers to security questions on sites that use those. DON'T use real answers as those can easily be guessed or figured out by threats!!!
- [ ] use [visiblelabs](https://remover.visiblelabs.org/) data broker removal tool as it is free and gets you removed from a lot of databrokers including ones based in the eu
- [ ] opt out of data brokers using the [delete-links.md](delete-links.md) to opt out of a few not covered by the previous tool
- [ ] use [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) to search your account name/names and delete any accounts you no longer use. check [justdeleteme.xyz](https://justdeleteme.xyz/#) for guides on how to delete most accounts

## Payment required things
- [ ] get a hardware key for 2fa, recommend [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) and [nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com/). make sure to get at least 2 to have one as backup if you lose the other!!!
- [ ] get your own domain name for email
- [ ] setup [proton](https://proton.me/) and [tuta](https://tuta.com/) email accounts
- [ ] vpn, recommend [mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) and [ivpn](https://www.ivpn.net/en/)
- [ ] rfid/faraday wallet

- [ ] google pixel with [grapheneos](https://grapheneos.org/)
- [ ] alternative degoogled android phones: [Comparison of Android-based Operating Systems](https://eylenburg.github.io/android_comparison.htm)
- [ ] use [incogni](https://incogni.com/) for databroker removal as it is the main option that works in the EU
